# Branching strategy
To allow my files to be copied to other directories, branches will be used instead of having to copy from directory to directory.

<li>Each project will have a main branch to store the code and final product</li>
<li>There will be develop sub-branch that will be directly created from main branch</li>
<li>Changes will be made in develop branch without affecting the code in main branch</li>
<li>Every feature created will be named and have a proper description</li>
<li>After each and every change in the branch the push command will be used to commit all the changes to the repository</li>
<li>To apply all the changes to the main branche pull request will be opened and merge the code to the main branch</li>


# The use of gitignore file
To avoid files that are not important to be generated to the repository the gitignore file will be used.
It will be used to not track generated files from project code  and don't upload them to the project repository
The size of repository will be reasonable and it will have less issues

# Storage of Sensitive Information and credentials

Sensitive information and credentials about my project will secured using github secret in management tool, to avoid them being leaked to where they will be vulnearable to attacks.

The secret feature will be enabled in the management tool to store all my sensitive information such as credentials, API keys and public profile of my web app.
The secret will help to encrypt my data before it reachces my github and make sure that it remain encrypted until being ready to be used
