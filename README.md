# Branching strategy

<b><li>main</b></li>
There will be main branch whre the code and final product of the project will stored.

<b><li>develop</b></li>
The develop branch will be created directly from the main branch. 
Changes in the project will be made in this branch without affecting anything in the main branch.
 
<b><li>Feature</b></li>
The feature that is being worked will have a proper description and name for the branch

<b><li>Release</b></li>
The features that have been designed in the develop branch will be contained for release.
To update changes within the project, the push command will be used.
Once the changes to the project are now ready to be used, pull request will be opened, then merged.

<b><li>Hotfix</b></li>
Issues that are being encountered within the project will solved in this branch.

# The use of gitignore file

It is used to not track generated files from project code  and don't upload them to the project repository
The size of repository will be reasonable and it will have less issues
